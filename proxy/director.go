	// Usecase might be appending backend endpoint (or name) to the protobuf serialized response, so that response is enhanced

	// When proxying one to many, if one the requests fails or upstream returns an error, it is undesirable to fail the whole
	// request and discard responses from other backends. BuildError converts (marshals) error from backend into protobuf encoded
	// response which is analyzed by the caller, so that caller reaching out to N upstreams receives N1 successful responses and

// StreamDirector returns a list of Backend objects to forward the call to.
//
// There are two proxying modes:
//   1. one to one: StreamDirector returns a single Backend object - proxying is done verbatim, Backend.AppendInfo might
//      be used to enhance response with source information (or it might be skipped).
//   2. one to many: StreamDirector returns more than one Backend object - for unary calls responses from Backend objects
//      are aggregated by concatenating protobuf responses (requires top-level `repeated` protobuf definition) and errors
//      are wrapped as responses via BuildError. Responses are potentially enhanced via AppendInfo.
//
// The presence of the `Context` allows for rich filtering, e.g. based on Metadata (headers).
// If no handling is meant to be done, a `codes.NotImplemented` gRPC error should be returned.
//
// It is worth noting that the StreamDirector will be fired *after* all server-side stream interceptors
// are invoked. So decisions around authorization, monitoring etc. are better to be handled there.
//
// See the rather rich example.
